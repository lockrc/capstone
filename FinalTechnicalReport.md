## Abstract
Brief 200-300 word description of project objectives, methods and results.

## Keywords

## Table of Contents and Lists of Figures and Tables
TOC should list sections, titles up to second level headings with hyperlinks to subsequent sections

## Introduction and Project Overview (~800-1200 words)
This section should be written assuming your reader has zero knowledge of your work and its background. You must bring the reader from "zero" to a level where they can understand the main ideas and results of your work. (This should be derived primarily from your Final Project Description document)

Introduces the problem, objectives, and the users (or customers) of project results, context of problem and issues that affect solution choices
Describes relevant background information. May include any alternative solutions (are there existing solutions or similar systems? give references) in terms of strengths and weaknesses.
Describe value or benefits of your solution and results
Problem scope--problems addressed and not addressed
Figures and system diagrams where possible to illustrate problems and solutions.
Summary of features

## Design, Development and Test (~800-1200 words)
This section describes your design and test approach. Subsections should include:

### Design 
Describe system components (e.g. software modules/components, libraries, etc.), interfaces, and operations. Use figures to illustrate your description, for example: photos, block diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, flow charts, tables, etc.
### Development
Describe how system was developed (for example, order of subsystem development and how risks were addressed early)
### Test
Describe your test approach (what was tested, how tested, what was not tested). You should organize this by feature (as you did for the System Features assignment).

As a guide to the level of detail, someone with your level of experience should be able to substantially reproduce your work from the descriptions in this section along with Introduction section.

## Results (~800-1200 words)
Actual results of project. Describe how well you met your objectives, feature by feature. A table of results will help to summarize this.
This section describes final system in terms of features completed and actual performance of the system under test.
Include discussion of problems encountered, accuracy of estimates
Use figures and diagrams whenever possible
## Conclusions and Future Work (~400-800 words)
Briefly summarize problem, approach and results
Describe your conclusions and "lessons learned" regarding the results
Describe utility of results
Suggest areas for further study and/or development
## References
Provide references in standard ACM format (numbers in text correspond to numbered references here).
List all references to code used as part of your system (libraries, etc.)
## Appendices (optional)
Any additional tables and graphs that support the reading of your paper
Code listings or examples that help the reader better understand your design (your code, not that of other authors)
